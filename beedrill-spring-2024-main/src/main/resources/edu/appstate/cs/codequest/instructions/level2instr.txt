As you delve deeper in the data center's architecture, you stumble upon
a corrupted section of the system plagued by intermittent network 
disruptions. The sporadic communication channels render repeated
command requests ineffective. By crafting a script, you can anticipate 
the erratic network behavior and preemptively plan your movement through
this system. 

You can no longer issue singular commands one by one. 

Write a script using a series of directional commands
("MoveU", "MoveD", "MoveL", "MoveR"), each on a new line, to  
navigate your character to the reboot point. Press the submit button 
to execute your script and observe your character's movement.
