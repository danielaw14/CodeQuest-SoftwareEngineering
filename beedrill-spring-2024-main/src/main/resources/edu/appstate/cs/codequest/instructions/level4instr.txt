As you continue your journey through the data center, you 
encounter a new challenge: the Security Protocol. This 
protocol, designed to ensure the integrity of the system, 
requires authentication to proceed further. However, 
the protocol has become overly strict, making it difficult to 
progress. 

Your task is to navigate through the system to the reboot point, 
like before, but you will now need to use if statements to 
meet authentication critera. Use if statements to check if 
the player can move ("canMoveU", "canMoveD", "canMoveL", 
"canMoveR") before moving.
