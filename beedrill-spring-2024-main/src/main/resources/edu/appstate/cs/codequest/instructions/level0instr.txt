Hello and Welcome to Code Quest!
Code Quest is an interactive learning platform
that teaches basic coding logic in a game format.

The backstory: A data center suffers a critical system failure. 
Almost all systems are shutdown or no longer functional. 
You are a technician employed for the data center. 
Your job is to get the system up and running again. 
You have a single process that you have control of, 
but you only have intermittent contact with this process. 
You must write code to navigate this process through the 
failed systems and get them up and running.For now you must 
reboot the system by guiding yourself through the 
computer system with simple commands.
